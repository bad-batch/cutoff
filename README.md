* Generates changelog based on angular-style commits since last git tag.
* Updates package version and git tag automatically based on release type.
* Exposes pre- and post-versioning npm script hooks to run custom tasks.
* Commits changelog, version and custom task changes to master prior to cutting tag.
* Provides separate cli command to publish new version to npm.
* Offers all of the above for fixed-mode Lerna-based monorepos.

## Installation

```bash

```

## Commands

### cutoff

The script cuts a major, minor or patch release, generates/updates the changelog, runs the pre-versioning
npm script hook, updates the project version, runs the post-versioning npm script hook, commits the changes to master
with the message `"Release version <version>."`, and then commits a new tag with the same message.

Include the `--preview` flag to stop the script after the post-versioning npm script hook, so no changes are
committed to master.

```json
"scripts": {
  "cutoff": "cutoff"
}
```

```bash
yarn run cutoff [--type <major | minor | patch>] [--preview]
```

### cutoff-lerna

The script cuts a major, minor or patch release, generates/updates the changelog, runs the pre-versioning npm script
hook, updates the project, lerna config and package versions, writes the list of updated packages to
`.lerna.updated.json`, runs the post-versioning npm script hook, commits the changes to master with the message
`"Release version <version>."`, and then commits a new tag with the same message.

Include the `--preview` flag to stop the script after the post-versioning npm script hook, so no changes are
committed to master. Include the `--force` flag to force update all packages to the new version.

```json
"scripts": {
  "cutoff-lerna": "cutoff-lerna"
}
```

```bash
yarn run cutoff-lerna [--type <major | minor | patch>] [--preview] [--force]
```

### publish-cutoff

The script publishes the project to npm with the new version.

```json
"scripts": {
  "publish-cutoff": "publish-cutoff"
}
```

```bash
yarn run publish-cutoff
```

### publish-lerna-cutoff

The script reads the `.lerna.updated.json`, iterates over each package in the list and publishes it to npm with the
new version.

```json
"scripts": {
  "publish-lerna-cutoff": "publish-lerna-cutoff"
}
```

```bash
yarn run publish-lerna-cutoff
```
